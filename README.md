# Who is PewDiePie?

Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, better known online as PewDiePie (/ˈpjuːdipaɪ/ PEW-dee-py), is a Swedish YouTuber, actor, comedian and gamer–commentator, best known for his YouTube video content, which mainly consists of Let's Play commentaries, vlogs, and comedic formatted shows.

Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, Kjellberg originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, he dropped out of Chalmers after losing interest in his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, Kjellberg began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and worked at a hot dog stand. Kjellberg soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.

# PewDiePie vs T-Series

On 5 October 2018, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track against T-Series titled "TSERIES DISS TRACK" in response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass PewDiePie in subscribers. On the prospect of being surpassed by T-Series in terms of subscriber count, Kjellberg stated, "I don't really care about T-Series, [...] but I think if YouTube does shift in a way where it does feel more corporate, then something else will take its place."Variety noted that many fellow YouTubers, including MrBeast and Markiplier, encouraged their viewers to subscribe to the PewDiePie channel.[150] Efforts to keep Kjellberg's channel ahead of T-Series in terms of subscribers also included multiple instances of hackers exploiting several thousands of printers to print out messages asking people to subscribe to PewDiePie, unsubscribe from T-Series, and upgrade their printer security. Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series, commented "I am really not bothered about this race. I don't even know why PewDiePie is taking this so seriously. He's getting his people to push him, promote him. We are not competing with him."Online campaigns to subscribe to PewDiePie greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber count; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.

On 22 February 2019, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his show Meme Review featuring entrepreneur Elon Musk and Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland. A segment from the video involving Elon Musk bursting into laughter at a meme involving a deer submerged in a pool captioned "Why my dolphin not working lol" was particularly noted by media outlets.  

# The End

On 28 April 2019, Kjellberg uploaded a video entitled "Ending the Subscribe to Pewdiepie Meme" in which he asked his followers to refrain from using the phrase "Subscribe to PewDiePie" due to incidents such as the phrase being graffitied on a war memorial.
